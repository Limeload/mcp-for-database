## 🚀 What is MCP Database Console?

**MCP Database Console** is a cutting-edge web application that transforms natural language into powerful database queries. Built with Next.js and powered by the MCP-DB Connector, it democratizes database access by allowing users to interact with databases using plain English instead of complex SQL syntax.

### 🎯 The Problem We Solve

- **SQL Complexity**: Writing SQL queries requires technical expertise and knowledge of database schemas
- **Accessibility**: Non-technical users struggle to extract insights from databases
- **Time Consumption**: Developers spend significant time writing and debugging SQL queries
- **Learning Curve**: New team members need time to understand database structures

### 💡 Our Solution

Transform natural language into powerful database queries through an intuitive web interface that:

- **Understands Context**: Interprets user intent from conversational prompts
- **Supports Multiple Databases**: Works with SQLAlchemy, Snowflake, and SQLite databases (backend implementation required)
- **Provides Real-time Results**: Shows query results instantly in formatted tables
- **Handles Errors Gracefully**: Offers helpful error messages and suggestions

### 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Democratize Data Access**: Enable non-technical users to query databases
- **Increase Productivity**: Reduce time spent on query writing and debugging
- **Improve Accuracy**: Minimize SQL syntax errors through natural language processing
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Allow team members to share insights without SQL knowledge

### Quick Start for Contributors

---

## Local development (mock MCP)

If you don't have a running MCP-DB Connector locally, the repository includes a small mock server to exercise the frontend during development.

- Start the mock MCP server (listens on port 8000 by default):

```powershell
npm run mock:mcp
```

- Start the Next.js dev server in a separate terminal:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Open the app and try the Test Connection button:
  - Visit http://localhost:3000/db-console
  - Choose a target (e.g. `snowflake` or `sqlite`) and click **Test Connection**

- You can also call the mock endpoints directly for quick checks:

```powershell
# POST to mock test-connection
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-connection -Body (@{ target = 'snowflake' } | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json'

# POST a mock query
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/query -Body (@{ sql = 'select 1' } | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json'
```

Notes:

- The mock server logs incoming requests to the terminal to help with debugging.
- If port 8000 is already in use, set `MOCK_MCP_PORT` before running the mock, and update `MCP_SERVER_URL` in `.env.local` if necessary.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- **MCP-DB Connector** server running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Limeload/mcp-for-database.git
   cd mcp-for-database
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### SQLite Local Development Setup

For local development with SQLite, follow these additional steps:

1. **Set up environment variables** for SQLite:

   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///local_dev.db
   ```

2. **Initialize the SQLite database** (requires Python and SQLAlchemy):

   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies (if not already installed)
   pip install sqlalchemy

   # Initialize database
   python scripts/init_sqlite.py

   # Optional: Add sample data
   python scripts/seed_data.py
   ```

3. **Configure your MCP server** to use SQLite backend

   **⚠️ Important**: The MCP-DB Connector server must be updated to support SQLite queries. The frontend now accepts SQLite as a target, but the backend server needs corresponding SQLite support.

4. **Start both servers**:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start MCP server (with SQLite support)
   # Your MCP server command here

   # Terminal 2: Start Next.js development server
   npm run dev
   ```

**SQLite Benefits for Development:**

- No external database server required
- File-based storage (`local_dev.db`)
- Easy to reset and recreate
- Perfect for testing and development

**SQLite Limitations:**

- Single-writer concurrency (not suitable for high-traffic production)
- No built-in user authentication or permissions
- Limited data types compared to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- File-based (backup and replication require manual processes)

### Usage

#### Database Console

Navigate to `/db-console` to access the database query interface:

1. **Enter a Prompt**: Describe what you want to query in natural language
   - Example: "Show me all users who registered in the last 30 days"
   - Example: "Find the top 10 products by sales"

2. **Select Database Target**: Choose between:
   - **SQLAlchemy**: For SQLAlchemy-based applications
   - **Snowflake**: For Snowflake data warehouse
   - **SQLite**: For local development with SQLite database

3. **Execute Query**: Click "Execute Query" to run your prompt

4. **View Results**: Results are displayed in a formatted table with:
   - Generated SQL query (if available)
   - Query execution time
   - Data results in tabular format

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# MCP Server Configuration
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database Configuration (if needed)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### TailwindCSS

The project uses TailwindCSS for styling. Configuration files:

- `tailwind.config.js` - TailwindCSS configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles
