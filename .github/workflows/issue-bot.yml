            Hi @${issueAuthor}! Thanks for opening this issue. We appreciate your contribution to the project! 🚀

            **Please note the following workflow guidelines:**

            - 🎯 **First-come, first-serve basis**: Issues are assigned based on who expresses interest first. Please comment on the issue to show your interest before starting work.

            - ⏳ **Wait for assignment**: Please **do not start working** until a maintainer has officially assigned this issue to you. This prevents duplicate work and ensures proper coordination.

            - 🔗 **Link your PR**: Once assigned, when you create your pull request, make sure to link it to this issue using \`Closes #${issueNumber}\` or \`Fixes #${issueNumber}\` in your PR description.

            - ⏰ **2-day timeline**: Aim to complete your work and submit a PR within **2 days** of assignment. If you need more time, please comment on this issue to discuss an extension.

            - ✅ **CI checks must pass**: Before requesting a review, ensure your PR passes all automated checks (TypeScript, linting, build, security). You can see the status in the PR checks section.

            **Need help?** Feel free to ask questions in the comments or reach out to maintainers.
